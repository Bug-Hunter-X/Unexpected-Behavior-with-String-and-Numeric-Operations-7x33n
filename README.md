This example demonstrates a common pitfall in Perl: implicit type coercion during arithmetic operations.  When you add a number to a string, Perl attempts to convert the string to a number.  If the string cannot be interpreted as a number, this will lead to either unexpected results or runtime errors, depending on the context. The solution provides a robust way to handle potential errors using explicit type checking and error handling.
